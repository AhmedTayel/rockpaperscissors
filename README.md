## Rock, Paper, Scissor Game
very simple
what i learned:
 - cant use scss without css
 - bootstrap feels restrictive probably because im not used it 
 - updating website elements using javascript
 - making the website intuitive by disabling buttons by adding attributes using javascript
 - addEventListener works better when the second parameter is "() => {function}" instead of "function" right away, otherwise the functions are called instantly on run
 - when linking a js script in the header, the js file doesnt fetch elements because it runs before the DOM, but putting in the header feels right, adding "async" in the link tag    lets the DOM parse before running the javascript file (asynchronously)
 - must read more about bootsrap rows
 - you can't link two style sheets
